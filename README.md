## üåü Features
- **Convex Hull Construction:** Calculates the convex hull for the given set of points.  
- **Minimum Enclosing Triangle:** Efficiently computes the smallest triangle that can enclose all the points.  
- **Interactive Visualization:** Allows users to interactively view the points, convex hull, and the resulting triangle.  
- **UI Language:** The user interface is fully localized in **Ukrainian**.
